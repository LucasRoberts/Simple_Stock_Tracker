Simple stock tracking program

This is a simple stock tracking program using BeautifulSoup4, requests, lxml, and xlwt.
As one of my first projects, I believed it was important to start with a small project so as to not get overloaded.
I understand there are libraries designed to tracking stock prices however, I wanted to use this as a learning opportunity.
My main focus for this project was to familiarize myself with the BS4 and requests libraries.
Once I am able to finish the programming portion of this project I would like to use the data collected to create a simple line graph charting the stocks performance.
